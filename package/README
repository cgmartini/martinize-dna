Martini DNA - 14.08.2015

This package includes files for creating and running systems using Martini DNA
force field.

This package includes the release version of the parameters.


The package contains:
  martini_v2.1-dna.itp      The general force field file with the new smaller 
                            bead types for DNA bases. 
  martini_v2.1P-dna.itp     Force field file for simulations with polarizable
                            water.
  martini_v2.0_ions.itp     The default martini ion parameters.
  martinize-dna.py          A version of martinize.py script for creating 
                            topologies for DNA molecules. Under development
                            and currently works only when the input file 
                            contains only the DNA molecule in .gro format.
  example.mdp               An example mdp file, just the default Martini
                            mdp with a shorter time step. 
  dna_backmapping_files/    Files required to backmap DNA using Backward.
  README                    This readme file. 


Please note:

Martinize-dna.py works better with GRO files so convert your PDB files 
using editconf or another program. 

In your .top file the #define RUBBER_BANDS has to be set before you include
an itp file with elastic network in order for that EN to be active.

Martinize-dna.py writes output to stdout, please read that to ensure that
your topology was created successfully. Check espeacially whether the 
DNA strands were recognized correctly (number of strands and lengths).


Usage:

There are four separate topology types that martinize-dna.py can create. For 
simulating single-stranded DNA there are parameters without elastic network. 
For double-straned DNA there is a weakly restrained model that allows more 
realistic bending of DNA but still has known issues with the alignment of bases
and stability when used with a longer time step. A very stiff elastic network 
model is offered as an alternative solution for systems where DNA structure is
not expected to change. For structures formed out of single strand but with a 
well defined structure also a stiff elastic network is offered to prevent the
structure from changing. There is also an option to restrain several strands
using the same elastic network which can be used as basis for elastic networks
of more complicated DNA structures.
